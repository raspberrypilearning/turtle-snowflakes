## Pythonタートルで描く方法

+ Open the [blank Python template trinket](http://jumpto.cc/python-new).

+ Type the following into the window that appears:

    The line `#!/bin/python3` just tells your computer that we're using Python 3 (the latest version of Python).

+ To begin using Turtle in Python, you need to import the Turtle library. At the top of the text editor window, type `import turtle`.

+ Time to give your turtle a name! You can use a variable to do this. I'm naming my turtle `elsa`, but you can name yours whatever you like.
    
    ```python
    elsa = turtle.Turtle()
    ```

+ Now you can tell your turtle what to do, for example, to move forward `100`. Give it a go!
    
    ```python
    elsa.forward(100)
    ```

+ Click on **Run** to run your first Turtle program. What happens?
