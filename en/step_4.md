## Using loops to create shapes

To create a square, you have repeated some lines of code. This is not the most efficent way of doing it. Instead of typing out many lines of code, it's easier to use a loop.

Instead of code to create a square like this:
  
```python
elsa.forward(100)
elsa.right(90)
elsa.forward(100)
elsa.right(90)
elsa.forward(100)
elsa.right(90)
elsa.forward(100)
```
  
You can type:
  
```python
for i in range(4):
  elsa.forward(100)
  elsa.right(90)
```
  
Try it yourself, and see what happens when you save and run your code.
