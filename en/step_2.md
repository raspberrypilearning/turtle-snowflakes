To begin using Turtle in Python, you need to import the Turtle library. At the top of the text editor window, type `import turtle`.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 1
---
import turtle
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

Time to give your turtle a name! You can use a variable to do this. Here it is called `elsa`, but you can name yours whatever you like.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 3
---
import turtle

elsa = turtle.Turtle()
--- /code ---
--- /task ---  

--- task ---

Now you can tell your turtle what to do, for example, to move forward `100`. Give it a go!

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 4
---
import turtle

elsa = turtle.Turtle()
elsa.forward(100)
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

Click on **Run** to run your first Turtle program. What happens?
