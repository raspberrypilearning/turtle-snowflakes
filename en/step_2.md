    The line `#!/bin/python3` just tells your computer that we're using Python 3 (the latest version of Python).
    
+ To begin using Turtle in Python, you need to import the Turtle library. At the top of the text editor window, type `import turtle`. 
  
+ Time to give your turtle a name! You can use a variable to do this. I'm naming my turtle `elsa`, but you can name yours whatever you like.

  ```python
  elsa = turtle.Turtle()
  ```

+ Now you can tell your turtle what to do, for example, to move forward `100`. Give it a go!

  ```python
  elsa.forward(100)
  ```
  
+ Click on **Run** to run your first Turtle program. What happens?
