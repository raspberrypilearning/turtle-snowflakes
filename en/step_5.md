## Creating spiral patterns

Enough squares! Let's create some different shapes and repeat them to make a snowflake-like spiral.

- Replace the code for your square with the following:

  ```python
  for i in range(2):
      elsa.forward(100)
      elsa.right(60)
      elsa.forward(100)
      elsa.right(120)
  ```
  
  This will draw a shape called a parallelogram. You can see what it looks like by saving and running your code.

You can put loops inside of other loops. This is good news for us, as we can do this to easily make a drawing that looks like a snowflake.

- Above the line `for i in range(2):` for your parallelogram, type:

  ```python
  for i in range(10):
  ```
  
  How many times will this loop go round?

- Move your cursor to the line below your sequence of code, and press the space bar four times to **indent** the code you're about to write. Indentation in Python is very important to ensure that your code works as you expect! Now type:

  ```python
  elsa.right(36)
  ```

- Save and run your code to see what happens. You should see a drawing like this:
