## How to turn with Python Turtle

Your turtle is only moving in one direction so far. This is good news if you want to draw a straight line, but to draw a shape such as a square, your turtle is going to have to turn.

- Below the line `elsa.forward(100)` in your Python code, add:

  ```python
  elsa.right(90)
  ```
  
  **Note:** Turtle uses angles in degrees. There are 360 degrees in a circle. How many degrees does the right angle of a square have? That's right: 90. The value `90` inside the brackets in `elsa.right(90)` is in degrees. So this line is telling your turtle to turn right by 90 degrees.
  
- Add another instruction below to move your turtle forward by 100:   

  ```python
  elsa.forward(100)
  ```
  
- Save and run your code to see what happens.

You are on your way to creating a square! What do you need to add to your code in order to complete the square?
