## Challenge: every snowflake is different

- Can you uncomment the random colour instruction and place it in the function, so that each branch has a different colour?
- Can you create a snowflake function and then repeat it all over the window to create a snowflake landscape?
- Can you draw snowflakes of different colours and different sizes, like those in Carrie Anne's video [Make snowflakes with code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHmeX7YTHBY)?
